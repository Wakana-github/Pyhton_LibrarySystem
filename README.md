This program (LibrarySystem.py) is written in Python to imitate a library system that allows us to read book information from an external file(books.txt), display the book list, add a book, remove a book from the list, and export the new book list to the external file. 
This repository also contains test cases and a Nassi-Shneiderman diagram.
